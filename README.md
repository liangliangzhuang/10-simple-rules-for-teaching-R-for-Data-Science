# 10 simple rules for teaching R for Data Science 

Tiffany A. Timbers
(Talk for 2022 Cascadia R conference)

This talk will present 10 simple rules I follow when teaching R for Data Science. 
These rules have been largely learned from others in the R, 
data science and computational education community. 
I have trialed and tested them in my teaching of R for Data Science throughout the past 6 years 
in both undergraduate and graduate Data Science courses at the University of British Columbia.
